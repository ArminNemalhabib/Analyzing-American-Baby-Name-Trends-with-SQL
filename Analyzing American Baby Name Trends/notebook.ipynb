Many males with the same name\n<p>Wow, Olivia has had a meteoric rise! Let's take a look at traditionally male names now.

Or, in the context of this problem, how do we find the male name given to the highest number of babies in a year? </p>\n<p>In SQL, one approach is to use a subquery. We can first write a query that selects the <code>year</code> and the maximum <code>num</code> of babies given any single male name in that year. For example, in 1989, the male name given to the highest number of babies was given to 65,339 babies. We'll write this query in this task. In the next task, we can use the code from this task as a subquery to look up the <code>first_name</code> that was given to 65,339 babies in 1989… as well as the top male first name for all other years!</p>"},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"43"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%sql\n\n-- Select year and maximum number of babies given any one male name in that year, aliased as max_num\nSELECt year, MAX(num) AS max_num\nFROM baby_names\nWHERE sex = 'M'\nGROUP BY year\nORDER BY MAX(num);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"50"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 7.
